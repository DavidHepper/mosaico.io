After more than a year of research and development of *Mosaico* our `Email Editor`, we decided this September to let it out as an `Open Source project` on GitHub.

![Mosaico OpenSource](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/voidlabs/mosaico.io/gh-pages/assets/images/mosaico_open_source.jpg)This decision was made after thinking a while, some dozen hours of meetings and an indeterminate number of cups of coffee (**espresso**, please).

`Mosaico` is born to be the standard responsive editor of the Italian **independent ESP [VOXmail](http://www.voxmail.it)**. Developing it was hard work: trying to keep the UX as smooth as possible while maintaining the desired level of flexibility.

###Mosaico is a Template-Driven Email Builder
The features and the complexity of the editor (and the flexibility given to the user) are **based on the template itself** and not hard-coded in the editor interface. This means that potentially anyone could convert a template to work with Mosaico.

As we said before **it was hard work**. These days, following the innovation started by `Mailchimp`, every large and small ESP has introduced its own editor. We think this is not the time to **reinvent the wheel**, so we took the decision to release `MOSAICO` as an open source project on GitHub. **Mosaico is a complete and stable javascript library**, you can download it, use it, implement it in your own software and so on.

Of course, **give us some feedback!** [how?]
