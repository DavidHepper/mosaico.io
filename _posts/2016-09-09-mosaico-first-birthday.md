Yes, today **MOSAICO grows up**: exactly one year ago, we released the **first version of MOSAICO code on GitHub**.

We've always thought that **MOSAICO would have been a "game changer"** in email template design: for the first time a complete and functional responsive email editor was **released as an open source project**.

Since that day **MOSAICO** project raised **over 400 stars and 140 forks on GitHub**, growing day by day.

Few days ago version **(0.15)** was released, with a **real major improvement**: now the **CSS inlining process** - a key in email compatibility - is made **directly by MOSAICO**, so that you now have total control on the email composition, including the final inlined result and you don't have to implement an inliner in your backend.

In these months our **blog** has pointed out some interesting news - and **email client issues** - like the one upon the infamous **"random 1px line bug" on Outlook 2016**.

The traffic on **Mosaico.io** is growing day by day and **tens of thousands of email template** have been created with our free editor: we are planning some **new feature on the site**, so keep an eye on it!

A full year has passed and Mosaico proved to stable and solid, so we are now ready to publish the **MOSAICO commercial version**: the open source project (under GPL licensing) is here to stay, but for those who can't accept GPLv3 requirements or need **professional support**, now we have a solution.

Check out the brand new page of **[MOSAICO Commercial Version](http://mosaico.io/commercial/)**!

So, a brand new Mosaico year is coming, **brace yourself**!
