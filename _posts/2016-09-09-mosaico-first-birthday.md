Yes, today **MOSAICO grows bigger**: exactly one year ago, we released the **first version of MOSAICO code on GitHub**.

We always thought that **MOSAICO would be a "game changer"** in email template design: for the first time a complete and functional responsive email editor has been **released as an open source project**.

Since then we walked far, and by now **MOSAICO** project has gain **over 400 stars and 140 forks on GitHub**, growing day by day.

Just few days ago a new version of the code **(0.15)** was released, with a **real major improvement**: now the **CSS inlining process** - a key in email compatibility - is made **directly by MOSAICO**.

This means that you have control on all the email composition, till the final inlined result.

Also our **blog** has pointed out some interesting news - and **email client issues** - like the one upon the infamous **"random 1px line bug" on Outlook 2016**.

The traffic on **Mosaico.io** is growing day by day and **thousands of email template** have been drawn with our free editor: we are planning some **new feature on the site**, so keep an eye on it!

Indeed one year is passed away in a moment, so, as planned since the first release, now we are ready to let out the **MOSAICO commercial version**: the open source project (under GPL licensing) will be always there, but for those who have business that requires **professional support**, commercial **third party integrations (such has Aviary and so on)** or need to modify MOSAICO without release **propietary code** (as GPL states), now we have a solution.

Check out the brand new page of **[MOSAICO Commercial Version](http://mosaico.io/commercial/)** and feel free to ask anything to our commercial support.

So, a brand new Mosaico year is coming, **brace yourself**!
