After more than an year of research and develop of our `Email Editor Mosaico`, we decided, this september, to let it out as `Open Source project` on gitHub.
This decision was made after thinking a while, some dozen hours of meeting and an undeterminated number of coffee cups (**espresso**, please).
![Mosaico OpenSource](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/voidlabs/mosaico.io/gh-pages/assets/images/mosaico_open_source.jpg)`Mosaico` is born to be the standard responsive editor of the italian **indipendent ESP [VOXmail](http://www.voxmail.it)**. Developing it was an hard work, trying to keep the UX as smooth as possible and maintain the certain level of flexibility.

`Mosaico is a Template driven Email Editor`. 
So the feature and the complexity of the editor (and the flexibility given to the user) is **based on the template itself** and not proprietary to the editor interface.
This means that potentially anyone could convert his template in order to work with Mosaico.

As we said before **it was an hard work**. In these years, after the innovation of `Mailchimp Editor`, every big or small ESP invented their own editor. We think there is no more time to **reinvent the wheel**, so we take the decision to release `MOSAICO` as an open source project on gitHub: **Mosaico is a complete and stable javascript library**, you can download it, use it, implement in your software and so on.
Of course, **give us some feedback!**
